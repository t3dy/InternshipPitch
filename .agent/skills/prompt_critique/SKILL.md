# Prompt Critique Skill

Use this skill to evaluate and improve the collaborative efficiency between a human and an AI agent.

## Instructions

1. **Signal-to-Noise Analysis**:
    - Identify turns where the user provided low-density information (e.g., "it's broken" without logs).
2. **Metacognition Points**:
    - Highlight times the user asks for a critique or reflects on their own process (e.g., "The Plan Gate").
3. **Context Engineering**:
    - Evaluate the use of handover documents and structured plans.
4. **Actionable Feedback**:
    - Provide a summarized "Critique Artifact" with specific tips for the next session.

## Examples

- "Error screenshots vs. Raw Log Text"
- "Plan Gate Methodology adoption"
- "Information Density per Turn"
