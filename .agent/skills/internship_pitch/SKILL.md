# Internship Pitch Creator Skill

Use this skill to transform complex technical projects into professional-grade internship pitches, specifically tailored for roles in systems engineering, instructional design, or digital humanities.

## Instructions

1. **Strategy Extraction**:
    - Identify the "Action Mapping" core: What was the goal? What interventions were built?
    - Highlight "Metacognition": How was the development process audited and improved?
2. **Technology Packaging**:
    - Group tools by impact (e.g., "Resilience" -> Zod/Vite, "Intimacy" -> Log Parsing/RAG).
    - Map technologies to the internal lessons learned (see `pkd_lessons.md`).
3. **Pitch Formatting**:
    - Generate a 2-minute video script following the "Aha! -> Crucible -> Human Connection" template.
    - Draft a "Systems Archeology" proposal for the specific client or industry.
4. **Competency Mapping**:
    - Quantify skills (IPC, State Management, Build Pipelines) into a Portfolio Database schema.

## Core Templates

- **Biographical Archaeology**: Applying log-tailing logic to archive management.
- **The Plan Gate**: Demonstrating engineering rigor through high-density AI collaboration.
- **Instructional Systems**: Reframing software as a tool for behavior change.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Does the pitch mention a specific business problem solved?
- [ ] Is there clear evidence of "Engineering Crucible" (overcoming technical blockers)?
- [ ] Does it bridge technology with human-centric goals?
