# Curriculum: Quantifying the Vibe (20 Lessons in Data Science & Interface Design)

This course focuses on the intersection of Data Science, Web Development, and Interface Design, specifically targeting the visualization of a "Quantified Learning Process."

---

## Module 1: The Data of Learning

### 1. The Atomic Turn
**Concept**: Visualizing "turns" in a conversation as the fundamental unit of progress.  
**Tech**: JSON parsing of chat logs to extract timestamped interaction nodes.

### 2. Semantic Density Mapping
**Concept**: Measuring the ratio of code change to prompt length.  
**Tech**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to quantify the "intent" vs. "execution" gap.

### 3. The Error Archipelago
**Concept**: Mapping clusters of lint errors and build failures over time to identify high-friction learning zones.  
**Tech**: D3.js scatterplots with coordinates based on error type and resolution time.

### 4. Categorical Entropy
**Concept**: Visualizing the shift from "Vibe" (high entropy) to "Plan" (low entropy).  
**Tech**: Shannon Entropy calculations applied to project terminology over time.

### 5. Temporal Velocity
**Concept**: Tracking the speed of feature implementation relative to the "Engineering Crucible" phase.  
**Tech**: Time-series analysis with moving averages of "Commit Volume."

## Module 2: Web Dev for Dynamic Insight

### 6. Relational Scaffolding
**Concept**: Building a React dashboard where projects are nodes in a larger "Systems Archeology" graph.  
**Tech**: `react-force-graph` for interactive, relational project navigation.

### 7. The Glassmorphic Archive
**Concept**: Using UI aesthetics (blur, transparency) to represent the "hidden layers" of AI collaboration.  
**Tech**: Advanced CSS backdrop-filters and glassmorphic design tokens.

### 8. Real-time Log Interrogation
**Concept**: Visualizing live data streams (like MTGA logs) as they flow through a browser-based parser.  
**Tech**: WebSocket or IPC-bridge integration for real-time UI updates.

### 9. Component State Archeology
**Concept**: Designing UIs that change state based on the "maturity" of the project data.  
**Tech**: React state management (Redux/Zustand) wired to a "Maturity Index" in JSON.

### 10. Responsive Scholasticism
**Concept**: Ensuring complex archival data remains legible across all device "viewports."  
**Tech**: CSS Grid and Flexbox patterns for non-traditional academic layouts.

## Module 3: Interface Design for Metacognition

### 11. The Prompt Critique Overlay
**Concept**: A UI that overlays feedback directly on the user's "Handover" documents.  
**Tech**: SVG annotations and absolute positioning for contextual feedback.

### 12. Visualizing the "Plan Gate"
**Concept**: A progress bar that doesn't track "lines of code," but "Plan Confidence."  
**Tech**: Custom React components based on Zod-validated "Verification Plans."

### 13. High-Signal Minimalism
**Concept**: Cribbing from shwep.net to present complex data without cognitive overload.  
**Tech**: Typography-first design systems focused on "Information Hierarchy."

### 14. The Metacognitive Radar
**Concept**: A spider chart (radar chart) showing growth in IPC, State Logic, and Digital Humanities.  
**Tech**: Chart.js or Recharts implementation of "Skill Densities."

### 15. The Annotated Journey
**Concept**: Interactive timelines where clicking a node reveals the "Aha!" moment from the logs.  
**Tech**: Intersection Observer API for scroll-linked storytelling.

## Module 4: The Synthesis Pitch

### 16. Narrative Data Structures
**Concept**: Formatting a portfolio so the data *is* the story.  
**Tech**: Static Site Generation (SSG) with Markdown-driven metadata.

### 17. The Artifact Carousel
**Concept**: Presenting "Drafts" vs. "Finals" to show the evolution of engineering rigor.  
**Tech**: Framer Motion for smooth, pedagogical UI transitions.

### 18. Quantifying the "Vibe"
**Concept**: A dashboard section that calculates the effectiveness of "Vibe Coding" vs. "Hard Engineering."  
**Tech**: Comparative bar charts of "Intervention Success Rates."

### 19. The Pitch Generator UI
**Concept**: Building an interface that takes project metadata and outputs a 2-minute script.  
**Tech**: Prompt-template string interpolation and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

### 20. The Eternal Archive
**Concept**: Ensuring the learning process is preserved for "Systems Archeology" years later.  
**Tech**: IPFS or GitHub Pages deployment for permanent, public-facing scholarly records.
