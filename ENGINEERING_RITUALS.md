# Engineering Rituals: The Claude Code Bin Analysis

## 🏛️ Systems Archeology: MTGOverlay
The MTGOverlay project represents a high-density engineering outcome where "Vibe Coding" was superseded by **Type-Safe Orchestration** and **Real-Time Log Interrogation**.

### Technical Rituals
- **The Crucible of IPC**: Implementation of a robust Electron-to-React bridge via `preload.ts` and `ipcMain`, ensuring shallow-cloned snapshots every 100ms.
- **Zod-Validated Schema**: Transitioning from "loose JSON" to strict, runtime-validated schemas for card identity (`mtgaId`, `grpId`).
- **Data Pipeline Rigor**: Integrating the **17Lands Service**—a custom CSV parser for life-cycle draft statistics (ALSA, GIH WR), mapping raw game IDs to competitive metrics.

### Outcomes
- **Metacognitive Feedback**: The "Replay Harness" allowed for testing log activity without launching the game client, localizing the "Vibe" within a controlled test environment.
- **Architectural Archeology**: Transforming a monorepo structure (`pnpm-workspace`) into a deployable desktop application.

## 🏗️ Technical Archeology: TreeTapper
The TreeTapper project (Bin B, Specialist role) focused on the **Logic of Interactivity**—specifically the mapping of esoteric color scales to functional UI elements.

### Key Rituals
- **Color Scale Attributions**: Transmuting traditional Tree of Life attributions (Hebrew, Tarot, Luria) into programmatically accessible data arrays.
- **Prototype Velocity**: Rapid iteration from `.txt` logic schemas to functional `.html` game loops, demonstrating the "Temporal Velocity" of the Vibe Coding process.
