# The Engineering Crucible: A Development Process

This document lavishly details the 9-day evolution of the **Internship Pitch Generator**, highlighting the shift from artistic experimentation to methodological rigor.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: The Vibe Coding Era (Feb 14 - Feb 18)
The project began as a series of "vibes"—exploring Tarot card aesthetics and basic log parsing for MTG Arena. 
- **Milestone**: The "Radiant Anthology" (v15.1) release.
- **Lesson**: Prompt quality directly correlates with "context leakage."

## 🏛️ Phase 2: Systems Archeology (Feb 19 - Feb 21)
The focus shifted to the **MTGA Overlay V2**, a technical crucible that forced a transition to **Win32 Geometry Sync** and **IPC Engineering**.
- **The "Aha!" Moment**: Recognizing that software isn't just a tool, but "scaffolding" for human behavior.
- **Action Mapping**: Implementing Zod for persistence and separating "Rendering" from "State."

## 🎓 Phase 3: The Instructional Pivot (Feb 22)
Recognizing the value of the *process*, the project was reframed as an **Instructional Design Agency**.
- **The Redesign**: Adopting the scholarly aesthetic of **shwep.net** (The Secret History of Western Esotericism Podcast) to mirror the "Archival" nature of the work.
- **Pitch Generation**: Codifying the process into **Claude Skills** (internship_pitch, journey_audit) for general-purpose use.

## 📊 Methodology: Action Mapping
In every project (PKD, Sound Legacy, MTGA), we applied the following mapping:
1. **Business Problem**: Identify the bottleneck (e.g., manual archival).
2. **Target Action**: Define the behavior needed for success (e.g., automated metadata generation).
3. **Software Scaffolding**: Build the tool that makes the action inevitable (e.g., the Biographical Tailer).

## 🚀 The Result
A living dashboard that doesn't just show *what* was built, but *how* the architect evolved.
