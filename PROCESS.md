# The Engineering Crucible: A Development Process

This document lavishly details the 9-day evolution of the **Internship Pitch Generator**, highlighting the shift from artistic experimentation to methodological rigor.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: The Vibe Coding Era (Feb 14 - Feb 18)
The project began as a series of "vibes"—exploring Tarot card aesthetics and basic log parsing for MTG Arena. 
- **Milestone**: The "Radiant Anthology" (v15.1) release.
- **Lesson**: Prompt quality directly correlates with "context leakage."

## 🏛️ Phase 2: Systems Archeology (Feb 19 - Feb 21)
The focus shifted to the **MTGA Overlay V2**, a technical crucible that forced a transition to **Win32 Geometry Sync** and **IPC Engineering**.
- **The "Aha!" Moment**: Recognizing that software isn't just a tool, but "scaffolding" for human behavior.
- **Action Mapping**: Implementing Zod for persistence and separating "Rendering" from "State."

## 🎓 Phase 3: The Instructional Pivot (Feb 22)
Recognizing the value of the *process*, the project was reframed as an **Instructional Design Agency**.
- **The Redesign**: Adopting the scholarly aesthetic of **shwep.net** (The Secret History of Western Esotericism Podcast) to mirror the "Archival" nature of the work.
- **Pitch Generation**: Codifying the process into **Claude Skills** (internship_pitch, journey_audit) for general-purpose use.

## 📊 Methodology: Action Mapping
In every project (PKD, Sound Legacy, MTGA), we applied the following mapping:
1. **Business Problem**: Identify the bottleneck (e.g., manual archival).
2. **Target Action**: Define the behavior needed for success (e.g., automated metadata generation).
3. **Software Scaffolding**: Build the tool that makes the action inevitable (e.g., the Biographical Tailer).

## 🤖 Agent Segregation: The Multi-Agent Workforce

To ensure transparency in our "Systems Archeology," we segregate the contributions of the primary AI agents utilized in this project.

### 🌌 Bin A: Antigravity (Project Architect)
- **Role**: High-level system design, multi-agent coordination, and curriculum development.
- **Key Contributions**:
    - **Agency Website**: Scaffolding the Vite+React architecture and SHWEP aesthetic.
    - **Digital Humanities**: Drafting the 40+ PK-Dick and Database lessons.
    - **Prompt Engineering**: Designing the specialized Claude Skills for pitch generation.
    - **Deployment**: Architecting the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

### 🤖 Bin B: Claude Code (Engineering Specialist)
- **Role**: Low-level implementation, log interrogation, and technical persistence.
- **Key Contributions**:
    - **Overlay V2**: Solving the Win32 geometry sync and IPC flooding hurdles.
    - **TreeTapper**: Rapid prototyping of game logic and state persistence.
    - **Log Parsing**: Real-time interrogation of MTGA log files using Zod.

## 📊 Total Coding Hour Analysis
Combined metrics from Antigravity logs and Claude Code self-audits.

| Phase | Human Interaction | Antigravity (Arch) | Claude Code (Eng) | Total "Internship" Hours |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Vibe Era** | 4.5h | 2.0h | 1.5h | **8.0h** |
| **Engineering Crucible** | 12.0h | 6.0h | 8.5h | **26.5h** |
| **Instructional Pivot** | 6.0h | 4.5h | 1.0h | **11.5h** |
| **TOTAL** | **22.5h** | **12.5h** | **11.0h** | **46.0h** |
