# The Phoenix Build: Multi-Agent Synthesis

This repository serves as the central command center for the **Sound Legacy Intake** internship portfolio. It synthesizes a decade of pedagogic exploration with high-end software engineering rituals performed by dual AI agents (**Antigravity** & **Claude Code**).

## 🚀 Live Dashboards & Projects

As requested, all built components are accessible via the following live links. These are functional websites, not just code repositories.

### Primary Command Center
- **[Phoenix Dashboard](https://t3dy.github.io/InternshipPitch/)** (Current)
  - *Synthesized by Antigravity & Claude Code*
  - Real-time engineering visualizations, hour analysis, and multi-agent narrative integration.

### Specialized Dashboards
- **[AlchemyDB Digital Humanities Archive](https://t3dy.github.io/AlchemyDB/)**
  - *Engineered by Claude Code*
  - A local-first extraction pipeline and dashboard for alchemical manuscripts.
- **[TreeTapper Pedagogic Prototype](https://t3dy.github.io/TreeTapper/)**
  - *Evolutionary Prototype*
  - A 15-year journey from classroom pedagogy to React Native engine development.

### Legacy Sector
- **[MTGOverlay V2 Archive](https://t3dy.github.io/InternshipPitch/legacy-v1/)**
  - *Engineered by Claude Code*
  - Preserved as a case study in technical debt (IPC flooding and system stress).

## 🛠 Multi-Agent Architecture

This project is a unique collaboration between two distinct AI personalities:

1.  **Antigravity**: Focus on UI/UX, scholarly aesthetics, and system synthesis.
2.  **Claude Code**: Focus on core engineering, data pipelines, and real-time state management.

## 📊 Hour Analysis
Total project effort is quantified at ~46.2 hours of engineering ritual, encompassing database architecture, real-time log interrogation, and curriculum development.
