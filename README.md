# Internship Pitch Generator: Systems Archeology Edition

An interactive portfolio and methodology tool designed to transform "Vibe Coding" experiments into professional systems engineering and instructional design outcomes.

## 🏛️ Purpose
This project serves as a live demonstration of **Action Mapping** and **Systems Archeology**. It was built to bridge the gap between creative prompt engineering and rigorous software development, specifically tailored for the **PKD Multimedia Archive** and **Sound Legacy** internship initiatives.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: [Browse the Project Database](#archive)
- **Methodology**: [The Action Mapping Process](./PROCESS.md)
- **GitHub Repository**: [t3dy/InternshipPitch](https://github.com/t3dy/InternshipPitch)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Scholarly Serif Aesthetic (Cribbed from [shwep.net](https://shwep.net))
- **Logic**: Zod-validated persistence, Hybrid Graph-Relational schemas.
- **AI Integration**: Custom Claude Skills for Internship Pitch creation.

## 📖 Features
- **Project Archive**: A relational database of technical achievements.
- **Digital Humanities Curriculum**: 40 lessons mapping philosophy to code.
- **Process Auditing**: Built-in "Metacognitive" feedback loops for prompt engineering efficiency.

## 📜 How to Use
1. **Explore the Archive**: Navigate through the "Project Archive" to see how systems-building logic was applied to diverse domains.
2. **Generate Your Pitch**: Use the integrated Claude Skills (in `.agent/skills`) to package your own journeys into professional pitches.
3. **Review the Methodology**: Read `PROCESS.md` for a deep dive into the "Engineering Crucible" that produced this tool.
